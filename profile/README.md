## ðŸ“– About Us

We are **Laskar Ai (Group LAI25-SM002)**, a team dedicated to tackling the critical challenge of flood disasters in Indonesia. Our country's geography makes it highly susceptible to floods, which cause significant damage and loss. We believe **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can greatly improve flood mitigation and management.

Our initial focus is **South Sulawesi**, a province with a high flood risk.

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Mission

To develop AI-driven tools that:

- Enhance flood prediction.
- Improve early warning systems.
- Support effective disaster response.
- Contribute to community resilience and well-being.
